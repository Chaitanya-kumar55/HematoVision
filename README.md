## 🚀 Project Overview

HematoVision classifies four major types of blood cells:
- **Eosinophils**
- **Lymphocytes**
- **Monocytes**
- **Neutrophils**

The system uses a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., **ResNet50** or **VGG16**) via **Transfer Learning** to provide accurate, scalable, and rapid diagnostics through a simple web interface built with **Flask**.
